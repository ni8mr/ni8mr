# Hi there, I'm Noor Faizur Reza

I am a passionate self-taught Full Stack Software Engineer from **Bangladesh**. My passion for software lies in dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

üî≠ I have worked on a variety of projects and products, ranging from fintech applications to climate tech solutions. I am currently working at [ME SOLshare LTD](https://solshare.com/).
